 |   The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 |
 |                           1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 |
 |    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 |
 |                        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
 |
 |    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
 |    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 |
 |    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
 |    hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
